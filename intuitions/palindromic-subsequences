What is a Subsequence?
 
Substring: A contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
Subsequence: Any sequence of characters in a string with their relative order is maintained.

Palindrome: The string is the same forwards and backwards

Question 
  Given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. 
  In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.
  
  Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.
  
  example
  Input: s = "baabb"
  Output: 2
  Explanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "". 
  Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".
  
Intuition:
 
 if string is Palindrome Return 1
 
 example 
"abab" -> "" = 1 step

if string is not Palindrome Return 2

example 
remove all a's = 1 step 
remove all b's = 2 step
